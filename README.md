# Raspberry-PI-MCP3208
Read data from MCP3208 on Raspberry Pi. 


# Documentation
This driver (application) communicates with the MCP3208 [1] ADC chip via SPI on the RaspberryPi. 
- [âœ“] Single-ended configuration only supported
- [x]	Differential configuration not supported


# Requirements:
- [X] Python 3

- [X] spidev 	
  
  
# Instructions:
1. Enable SPI interface on Raspi according to steps outlined in [5]. Remember to reboot Rasp Pi.
2. Wire MCP3208  to Raspi according to the diagram in [4]. MCP3208 pin details are in page 15 of [1].
3. Check that SPI is enabled on Raspi by entering "ls /dev/spi*" in the terminal. This should return "/dev/spidev0.0  /dev/spidev0.1"
